You are already familiar with playfair so lets handle the special cases.

You handle J as I.
When two characters are in the same row, you take the one on the right.
When two characters are in the same column, you take the one below.
If you end up with one letter, you append 'X' since it is slightly used in all languages and almost never coupled with another 'X'.
When two characters are the same, You separate them with 'X'
If you get two consecutive 'X' ('XX') you separate them by the second least used character which is 'Q'
You can play with reference algorithm at http://www.online.crypto-it.net/eng/playfair.html

Warning: The website is a playground to understand how things work. The website uses 'Q' rather than 'X' and 'V' rather than 'Q' so don't copy his solution.
